    "Our task is to analyse the overall carbon impact considering deforestation, tree planting, and carbon offset. Implement the analyse_carbon_impact function, which takes lists of deforested areas and planted trees, the carbon emission factor and an offset per tree as parameters. The function should return one of three categories: Positive, Neutral, or Negative, representing the overall carbon impact.\n",
