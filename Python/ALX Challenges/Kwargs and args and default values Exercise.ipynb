    "Write a Python function called calculate_forest_area that takes two parameters: trees and area_per_tree. The function should calculate and return the total area covered by the given number of trees. By default, assume that each tree covers 10 square metres of land. Additionally, the function should accept an optional parameter, deforestation_factor, with a default value of 0.2. This factor represents the percentage of the total area that has been deforested. The function should return the net forest area after considering deforestation.\n",
