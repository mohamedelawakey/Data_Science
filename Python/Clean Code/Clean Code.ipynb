    "### Introduction\n",
    "As we embark on the journey of writing code, it's essential to familiarise ourselves with guidelines and concepts regarding code styling. The art of coding transcends the mere act of typing words and expecting them to compile; the format and style of these words are of paramount importance. In the same manner that poorly punctuated text hinders comprehension, poorly formatted code challenges readability. To enhance the readability of our code, we shall turn to the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP), specifically PEP 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, there is an image serving as a PEP 8 Cheat Sheet. Throughout this train, we will delve deeper into each of these elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of code we've seen up to this point in the course is according to PEP 8, so the guidelines below are just formalising what we've seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 guidelines are just that – guidelines. They should be broken if it improves readability and doesn't break compatibility, but we have to apply it consistently."

    "### Why is it important?\n",
    "Data scientists, like other software developers, benefit greatly from learning and implementing coding best practices. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code reusability and reproducibility: Data science involves a lot of exploratory work where a particular analysis might need to be run multiple times with slight variations. Well-structured and properly documented code is easier to understand, reuse, and reproduce, which is crucial in data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collaboration: Data science is typically a team effort, and having a consistent coding style makes it easier for different team members to understand each other's code. This leads to more efficient collaboration and less time spent deciphering what a piece of code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintenance and debugging: Data science projects are not always 'one-off' analyses. Models might need to be updated, bugs might need to be fixed, or new data might need to be incorporated. Following best practices makes maintaining and debugging code significantly easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scaling and performance: As data grows in volume and complexity, code that follows best practices tends to be more efficient and easier to scale. This is especially important for data scientists working with big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Professional development: Understanding and implementing best coding practices helps data scientists write higher-quality code. This could increase their employability and offer more opportunities for growth within their current roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Communication of results: The ultimate goal of most data science projects is to inform decision-making. High-quality, well-structured code helps ensure that the results are reliable and accurate, which is critical for gaining trust and effectively communicating results to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, for data scientists, following coding best practices is not just about writing good code. It's also about ensuring the reliability and credibility of their findings and making their work more efficient and impactful."
